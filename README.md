Thinking in Algorithms: A set of solved problems in algorithms with mathematical flavor.

The following is a list of interesting problems in algorithms inspired in several projects and books in algorithms. 

P1.- Given a number M, calculate the sum of all the multiples of k and n smaller than M.

P2.- Calculate the sum of all the odd Fibonacci numbers smaller than N. Additionally, Calculate the sum of all the even Fibonacci numbers smaller than N.

P3.- Write an algorithm to verify if a number is palindrome.

p4.- Given two numbers a and b, find the largest palindrome of the form s=a*b, where a and b have 4 digits.
